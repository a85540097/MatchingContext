# We describe here the EMC vocabulary
- The Entity Maching Context (EMC) of a pair of instances is represented by a property that links these two instances. 
For example, the most specific EMC for players Adam May and Jack Lankester is the EMC with the following identifier: emc\_e3\_d3\_o3. 
This gives us the triple:
```
    Adam_May emc:emc\_e3\_d3\_o3 Jack_Lankester .
```
