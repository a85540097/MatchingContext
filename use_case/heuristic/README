Heuristic to restric the number of EMCs computation.

The aim of this heuristic is to determine a cosine similarity value
which serves as a threshold value below which the calculation of EMCs is of no interest for contextual identity discovery.
We make the hypothesis that contextual identity link discovery is relevant for pairs belonging to the same type (here: footballer).
On the basis of this hypothesis, we are looking for a threshold below which the number of footballers decreases steadily.


1) From the file that list all the vectors and cosine similarity with the footballer Adam_May,  
we have picked up 6 cosine values (from 0.1 to 0.6).
We have selected the 20 entities above each of these  values.
For example the following enitites are the entities that are above the cosine value 0.3: 

(http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_FC_Barcelona_managers,0.30003253)
(http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gauthild_Algautsdóttir,0.3000317)
(http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivan_Cavaleiro__CareerStation__12,0.3000315)
(http://dbpedia.org/resource/NK_Belišće,0.3000308)
(http://dbpedia.org/resource/J3_League,0.30003032)

(http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guy_Charron,0.300008)
(http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaétan_Bosiers,0.30000678)

This result is stored in the file slice_up03.
Results are in the files slice_upCOSINE_VALUE.

2) For each set of 20 entities we have counted the number of instances of type footballer present in the set.
The results are:

cosine 0.6: 9/20
cosine 0.5: 7/20
cosine 0.4: 15/20
cosine 0.3: 3/20
cosine 0.2: 0/20
cosine 0.1: 0/20 

3) Interpretation
The number of footballer decreases steadily below the value 0.3.
This threshold value allows us to process 54570 pairs instead of the 163.414 pairs
listed in the file Adam_May__footballer__xaa.
